  <button class="accordion">Requirement analysis</button>
<div class="panel">
  <h2>What is planning and requirement analysis in SDLC?</h2>
  <p>The most important phase of the SDLC is the requirement gathering and analysis phase because this is when the project team begins to understand what the customer wants from the project. During the requirements gathering sessions, the project team meets with the customer to outline each requirement in detail.</p>
  <p>End-user business requirement analysis takes place during this phase. Project goals are converted into the defined system functions that the organization intends to develop. The three primary activities involved in the analysis phase are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Gathering business requirement</li>
    <li>Creating process diagrams</li>
    <li>Performing a detailed analysis</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Business requirement gathering is the most crucial part at this level of SDLC. Business requirements are a brief set of business functionalities that the system needs to meet to be successful. This phase does not define technical details such as the type of technology implemented in the system. A sample business requirement might look like “The system must track all the employees by their respective department, region, and the designation.” This requirement shows no such detail as to how the system will implement this requirement, but rather what the system must do concerning the business.</p>

  <p>Defining requirements is a decision-making process to derive requirements from needs.</p>

<button class="accordion">Planning</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The planning phase will determine project goals and establish a high-level plan for the intended project. Planning is, by definition, a fundamental and critical organizational phase. The three primary activities involved in the planning phase are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identification of the system for development</li>
    <li>Feasibility assessment</li>
    <li>Creation of project plan</li>
  </ul>
     <h2>Defining The Application</h2>

<button class="accordion">Software design and architecture</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Advertisements. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.</p>

  <h2>What is architectural design in SDLC?</h2>
  <p>IEEE defines architectural design as “the process of defining a collection of hardware and software components and their interfaces to establish the framework for the development of a computer system.” The software that is built for computer-based systems can exhibit one of these many architectural styles.</p>
  <p>In the design phase, we describe the desired features and operations of the system. This phase includes business rules, pseudo-code, screen layouts, and other necessary documentation. The two primary activities involved in the design phase are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Designing the IT infrastructure</li>
    <li>Designing the system model</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
<button class="accordion">Software development</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> refers to a set of computer science activities dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying and supporting software.</p>
  <p>The development phase is when all documents from the previous step transfer into the system. The primary activities involved in the development phase are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Development of IT infrastructure</li>
    <li>Development of database and code</li>
  </ul>
  <p>During the design phase, just the IT infrastructure blueprint is provided. In contrast, the organization purchases and installs the respective software and hardware to support the IT infrastructure during the development phase. Following this, creating the database and actual code can begin to complete the system according to the specifications.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Software Testing</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do.</p>
  <p>All pieces of code are integrated during the testing phase and deployed in the testing environment. Testers then work through Software Testing Life Cycle activities to check the system for errors, bugs, and defects to verify the system’s functionalities work as expected. The two primary activities involved in the testing phase are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Writing test cases</li>
    <li>Execution of test cases</li>
  </ul>
</div>
  <button class="accordion">Documentation</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Documentation exists to explain product functionality, unify project-related information, and allow for discussing all significant questions arising between stakeholders and developers.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Deployment in the Market</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>During this next phase, the system is deployed to a real-life (the client’s) environment where actual users can begin operating the system. All data and components are present in the production environment. This phase is also called ‘delivery.’</p>
  <p> When the system meets your approval and is ready to “go live”, we deploy it to your production environment and assist with your organization’s transition to the new system.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Maintenance</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> The maintenance phase of the SDLC occurs after the product is in full operation. Maintenance of software can include software upgrades, repairs, and fixes of the software if it breaks. Software applications often need to be upgraded or integrated with new systems the customer deploys.</p>
  <p>Any necessary enhancements, corrections, and changes are made during the maintenance phase to ensure the system continues to work and remain updated to meet business goals. It is necessary to maintain and upgrade the system from time to time to adapt to future needs. The three primary activities involved in the maintenance phase are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Support the system users</li>
    <li>System maintenance</li>
    <li>System changes and adjustment</li>
  </ul>
