  <button class="accordion">Requirement analysis</button>
<div class="panel">
  <h2>What is planning and requirement analysis in SDLC?</h2>
  <p>The most important phase of the SDLC is the requirement gathering and analysis phase because this is when the project team begins to understand what the customer wants from the project. During the requirements gathering sessions, the project team meets with the customer to outline each requirement in detail.</p>
  <p>The planning phase will determine project goals and establish a high-level plan for the intended project. Planning is, by definition, a fundamental and critical organizational phase. The three primary activities involved in the planning phase are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identification of the system for development</li>
    <li>Feasibility assessment</li>
    <li>Creation of project plan</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Defining requirements and Deployed requests</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Defining requirements is a decision-making process to derive requirements from needs.</p>
  <h2>Defining the Requirements</h2>
  <h3>User Registration</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Username input field</li>
    <li>Password field</li>
    <li>Checkbox - accept Terms and Conditions</li>
    <li>Submit buttom</li>
     <li>Save user in database</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>User Login</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Username input field</li>
    <li>Password field</li>
    <li>Submit buttom</li>
     <li>Read user from database</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>User Logout</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Logout button</li>
    <li>Clear session</li>
    <li>Prevent account theft</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>User Logout</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Logout button</li>
    <li>Clear session</li>
    <li>Prevent account theft</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Dashboard</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>Main Home page</li>
    <li>New users shoud redirect here</li>
    <li>Existing users redirect here after login</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Planning</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>The planning phase of the SDLC is also when the project plan is developed that identifies, prioritizes, and assigns the tasks and resources required to build the structure for a project. With that said, this step culminates in a detailed project plan.</p>
     <h2>Defining The Application</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>User registration</li>
    <li>Login</li>
    <li>Logout</li>
    <li>Dashboard landing</li>
  </ul>

<button class="accordion">Software design and architecture</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Advertisements. Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.</p>

  <h2>What is architectural design in SDLC?</h2>
  <p>IEEE defines architectural design as “the process of defining a collection of hardware and software components and their interfaces to establish the framework for the development of a computer system.” The software that is built for computer-based systems can exhibit one of these many architectural styles.</p>
  
  </div>
<button class="accordion">Software development</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> refers to a set of computer science activities dedicated to the process of creating, designing, deploying and supporting software.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Software Testing</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do.</p>
</div>
  <button class="accordion">Documentation</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Documentation exists to explain product functionality, unify project-related information, and allow for discussing all significant questions arising between stakeholders and developers.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Deployment in the Market</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> When the system meets your approval and is ready to “go live”, we deploy it to your production environment and assist with your organization’s transition to the new system.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Maintenance</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> The maintenance phase of the SDLC occurs after the product is in full operation. Maintenance of software can include software upgrades, repairs, and fixes of the software if it breaks. Software applications often need to be upgraded or integrated with new systems the customer deploys.</p>
